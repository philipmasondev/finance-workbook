TODO:
landing page:
- if user is not logged in prompt to login or create account. 
- Once on the landing page there will be a navbar that will display the specified groups of components. 

TODO:
debt:
- When selected this will show list of accounts to be paid
- option to add account to track total debt and payments toward that debt. This will update to total balance as payments are made. 
- This page will show the accounts for the month, totals, due dates, etc. 

TODO:
deposit:
- This will show list of incoming funds such as:
    * paychecks, gift moneys, etc
- option to add accounts
- list of accounts for the month, dates money will be received, total for the month.

TODO:
dashboard.
- This is the landing page once user logs in.
